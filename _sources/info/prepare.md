# Welcome to Business Data Science

We are looking forward to meeting the first cohort üòé of Business Data Science as well as the Social Data Science students in September at AAUBS. 
Until then, here we put together a few resources that you can already now use to get started with Data Science and Python.

In the first month at the programme  - let's be honest - you'll face a rather steep learning curve if you have not prior experience with coding or professional data analysis. Even having developer experience is not a cure to experiencing that it is not easy at all. But what good would a master programme be if most people found it easy from the start?

Long story short: Below you will find a list with resources that you can freely access on the web. We value open resources but especially starting out it requires some "curating". Data Science is (experience from the past 4 years shows) a rabbit hole and we encourage you going deeper. Below we list some platforms like GitHub or Kaggle but you are always welcome to go beyond: Meaning that if you think you can see yourself developing an iOS app that integrates your  machine learning project...well, go for it. üöÄ


## Platforms to get familiar with
- Jupyter (Python) - [local install with anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/) - Install, play around üíæ
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Create an account and follow 101 tutorials üßë‚Äçüíª
- __[Kaggle](kaggle.com)__ - üßó Create an account, check out projects and competitions.

## Techniques and skills

- [madewithml](https://madewithml.com/)
    A good place to start is [madewithml](https://madewithml.com/). Built by a former Apple ML Engineer, it brings together most of the topics relevant for Data Science, Machine Learning and MLOps (things we will cover on the 2. semester).
    Start with üõ† toolkit (Notebooks to Pandas - no need to look into PyTorch for now). Explore then the üî• Machine Learning part - here, only linear and logistic regression as well as data quiality.

- [Youtube: Python Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/c/PythonEngineer)
    Are you really giving us a Youtube Channel here? Well, yes. Modern research communication, especially in computational disciplines is fast and open. Many engineers and researchers put out excellent contetent - sometimes of higher quality thatn academic publications, especially those that take many years to produce. This channel covers various topic in Data Science and software development more generally. Consider following the advanced python playlist. If you are very motivated, also the ML from scratch playlist. 


## Build your first project? (think about it perhaps)
- Think about a first project that you could work on during september.

```{note}
We are phasing out R specific support/material creation throuthgout 2022. If you work in R (RStudio), you are welcome to submit assignments in R. We will direct you to resources for R.
